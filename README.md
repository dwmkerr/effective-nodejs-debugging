# effective-nodejs-debugging

This is the code and ppt which goes with my JSChannel 2016 presentation on effective debugging of Node.js applications.

Large parts of the later demos use my example nodejs-microservice stack for Docker, this is extensively written up at [Learn Docker by building a Microservice](http://www.dwmkerr.com/learn-docker-by-building-a-microservice/).
